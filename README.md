# Trinidad

Trinidad allows you to run Rails or Rack applications within an embedded 
Apache Tomcat container.

* Bug Tracker: http://github.com/trinidad/trinidad/issues
* IRC Channel (on FreeNode): #trinidad

## Installation

```
$ jruby -S gem install trinidad
```

## Quick Start

```
$ cd myapp
$ jruby -S trinidad
```

### Setup

If you use Bundler, you might want to add Trinidad to your *Gemfile*:

```
gem 'trinidad', :require => nil
```

**Rails**

If you have Trinidad in your Gemfile you can start it with `rails server`:

```
$ rails s trinidad
```

or simply, if you prefer not to use the Rack handler, use:

```
$ trinidad
```

**Sinatra**

```
$ ruby app.rb -s Trinidad
```

or configure your application to always use Trinidad:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'trinidad'

configure do
  set :server, :trinidad
end
```

**Rackup**

You can pass the server name as an option to `rackup`:

```
$ rackup -s trinidad
```

Or you can set Trinidad by default in your `config.ru` file:

```
#\ -s trinidad
```

## Configuration

Trinidad allows you to configure parameters from the command line, the following 
is a list of the currently supported options (try `trinidad -h`):

```
  * -p, --port PORT               =>  port to bind to.
  * -e, --env ENVIRONMENT         =>  rails environment.
  * -c, --context CONTEXT         =>  application context path.
  * --lib, --jars LIBS_DIR        =>  directory containing jars.
  * --classes CLASSES_DIR         =>  directory containing classes.
  * -r, --rackup [RACKUP_FILE]    =>  run a provided rackup file instead of a rails application, by default it's config.ru.
  * --public PUBLIC_DIR           =>  specify the public directory for your application, by default it's 'public'.
  * -t, --threadsafe              =>  shortcut to work in threadsafe mode. Setting jruby_min_runtimes and jruby_max_runtimes to 1 in the configuration file the server behaves as the same way.
  * -l, --load EXTENSION_NAMES    =>  load extensions to use their command line options.
  * --address HOST                =>  set the server host.
  * -g, --log LEVEL               =>  set the log level, default INFO.
  * --apps APPS_BASE_DIRECTORY    =>  set the applications base directory.
```

You can also specify a default *web.xml* to configure your web application. 
By default the server tries to load the file *config/web.xml* but you can change
the path by adding the option `default_web_xml` within your configuration file.

### YAML Configuration

The server can also be configured from a .yml file. By default, if a file is 
not specified, the server tries to load *config/trinidad.yml*.
Within this file you can specify options available on the command line and tune 
server settings or configure multiple applications to be hosted on the server.

Advanced configuration options are explained in the wiki: 
http://wiki.github.com/trinidad/trinidad/advanced-configuration


```
$ jruby -S trinidad --config my_trinidad.yml
```

```yml
---
  port: 4242
  address: 0.0.0.0
```

### Ruby Configuration

As an alternative to the *config/trinidad.yml* file, a .rb configuration file 
might be used to setup Trinidad. It follows the same convention as the yaml 
configuration - the file `config/trinidad.rb` is loaded by default if exists.

```ruby
Trinidad.configure do |config|
  config.port = 4242
  config.address = '0.0.0.0'
end
```

### Logging

As you might notice on your first `trinidad` the server uses standard output :

```
kares@theborg:~/workspace/trinidad/MegaUpload$ trinidad -p 8000 -e staging
Initializing ProtocolHandler ["http-bio-8000"]
Starting Servlet Engine: Apache Tomcat/7.0.28
Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-bio-8000"]
Context with name [/] has started rolling
Context with name [/] has completed rolling
```

It also prints warnings and error messages on error output, while application 
specific log messages (e.g. logs from `Rails.logger`) always go into the expected
file location at *log/{environment}.log*. 

Application logging performs daily file rolling out of the box and only prints 
messages to the console while it runs in development mode, that means you won't
see any application specific output on the console say in production !

Please note that these logging details as well as the logging format will be 
configurable with *trinidad.yml/.rb* within the next **1.4.x** release.

If you plan to use a slice of Java with your JRuby and require a logger, consider 
using `ServletContext#log`. By default it is setup in a way that logging with 
`ServletContext` ends up in the same location as the Rails log. 
If this is not enough you can still configure a Java logging library e.g. SLF4J,
just make sure you tell Trinidad to use it as well, if needed, using the 
**jruby.rack.logging** context parameter in *web.xml*.

### Context Configuration

For slightly advanced (and "dirty" XML :)) application configuration Trinidad 
also supports the exact same *context.xml* format as Tomcat. Each web app is 
represented as a context instance and might be configured as such. You do not 
need to repeat configuring the same parameters you have already setup with the 
Trinidad configuration. This is meant to be mostly for those familiar with 
Tomcat internals.
Currently the application's *context.xml* is expected to be located on the 
class-path under your *[classes]/META-INF* directory.

Context Doc: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/context.html


## Hot Deployment

Trinidad supports monitoring a file to reload applications, when the file 
*tmp/restart.txt* is updated (e.g. `touch tmp/restart.txt`), the server reloads 
the application the file belongs. 
The file monitor can be customized with the `monitor` configuration option.

Since version **1.4.0** Trinidad supports 2 reload strategies :

* **restart** (default) synchronous reloading (exposed by Tomcat). This strategy
  pauses incoming requests while it reloads the application and than serves them
  once ready (or timeouts if it takes too long). It has been chosen as the default
  strategy since **1.4.0** due it's more predictable memory requirements.

* **rolling** "zero-downtime" (asynchronous) reloading strategy similar to 
  Passenger's rolling reloads. This has been the default since **1.1.0** up till
  the **1.3.x** line. If you use this you should account that your JVM memory
  requirements might increase quite a lot (esp. if you reload under heavy loads)
  since requests are being served while there's another version of the
  application being loaded.

Configure the reload strategy per web application or globally e.g. :

```yml
---
  port: 8080
  environment: production
  reload_strategy: rolling
```

## Virtual Hosts

It's possible to use Trinidad with multiple hosts and load the applications under 
them automatically. Please remember that each host must have its applications in 
a different directory.

```ruby
Trinidad.configure do |config|
  config.hosts = {
    # applications_path => host_name_list 
    # (first one is the real host name, the other ones are aliases)
    'app_local' => ['localhost', '127.0.0.1'],
    'apps_lol'  => ['lolhost', 'lol'],
    'apps_foo'  => 'foo'
  }
end
```

If applications are configured via the `web_apps` section, the host for each app
can be added with the `hosts` key under each application. 
If several applications belong to the same host put them under the same directory
and specify the name of the host for each one e.g. :

```ruby
Trinidad.configure do |config|
  config.web_apps = {
    :mock1 => {
      :web_app_dir => 'rails_apps/mock1',
      :hosts       => ['rails.virtual.host', 'rails.host']
    },
    :mock2 => {
      :web_app_dir => 'rails_apps/mock2',
      :hosts       => 'rails.virtual.host'
    },
    :mock3 => {
      :web_app_dir => 'rack_apps/mock3',
      :hosts       => ['rack.virtual.host', 'rack.host']
    }
  }
end
```
